# Smart Office Network Configuration

## Overview

This project simulates a smart office network setup using Cisco Packet Tracer. It involves configuring DHCP and DNS features, creating separate networks for office and server rooms, and incorporating IoT devices to establish a responsive, interconnected environment. The configuration allows IoT device management and provides internet connectivity for efficient and secure communication.

## Objectives

- Implement DHCP and DNS configurations for efficient network management.
- Configure IoT devices within a simulated office environment.
- Create separate office and server room networks with dynamic routing (RIP) to facilitate seamless communication.
- Develop essential network components for a smart office setup.

## Theory

### Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT devices are physical hardware components such as sensors, gadgets, or appliances that transmit data over networks. These devices facilitate automation and remote monitoring, transforming conventional setups into responsive digital systems. Integrating IoT into office networks enhances real-time data sharing and remote accessibility, making environments more adaptable and efficient.

### DHCP and DNS
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Automates IP address assignment for network devices, enabling efficient communication.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names into IP addresses, acting as the internet's phonebook to simplify online resource access.

## Tools and Requirements

- **Software:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Hardware:** Home Gateway, Routers, Server, IoT Devices, Straight Through Cabling, CrossOver Cabling
- **Network Protocols:** Dynamic Routing (RIP)

## Configuration Steps

1. **Network Creation:**  
   - Create two networks: one for the office and another for the server room. Establish dynamic routing (RIP) for seamless connectivity.

2. **DHCP Server Configuration:**  
   - Set up a DHCP server for automatic IP address allocation within the network.

3. **DNS Configuration:**  
   - Configure a local DNS server accessible from the server room for domain name resolution within the office environment.

4. **Office Network IoT Setup:**  
   - Establish a separate router network for IoT devices to enable remote access and automation.

5. **IoT Device and Home Gateway Configuration:**  
   - Set up and configure the home gateway for IoT devices. Ensure accessible connection from PCs within the network.

6. **Testing and Verification:**  
   - Verify connectivity, ensure DHCP IP assignment, DNS resolution, and test IoT device control from connected computers.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational understanding of a smart office network setup. Key features include DHCP configuration across different networks, local DNS management, and IoT integration for an adaptive office environment. This configuration enhances office connectivity, efficiency, and control over digital and IoT-enabled devices, paving the way for responsive, smart workspaces.
